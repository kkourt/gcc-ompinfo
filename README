This is a simple gcc plugin that draws a graph of the OpenMP constructs of a
progam using graphviz. The main motivation behind this was to investigate what
kind of information about OpenMP constructs can somebody get at compile time
using gcc.

An output example can be found here:
http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~kkourt/var/for-test.png

TODO:
 - Use the callgraph to get more information about the (possible) nesting of
   constructs. For example, we could draw edges from calls inside OMP
   constructs to functions that contain OMP constructs. Try to do this at
   link-time, also.
 - combine with profiling
 
Requirements:
 - gcc-4.6 (+plugin development files)
 - libgraph from graphviz
